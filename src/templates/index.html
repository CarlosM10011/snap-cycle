        <!--On average, Americans drink one beverage from an aluminum can every day.But we recycle just over 49% of the cans we use.
        Since the cans are 100% recyclable, we could drastically reduce the energy needed to produce brand new cans simply by recycling our empties.
        An aluminum can is able to be returned to the shelf, as a new can, as quickly as 60 days after it's put into your recycling container.
        Coast-to-coast, there are about 10,000 locations that buy aluminum, making it easy for Americans to redeem their used beverage cans for cash.
        In fact, recycling aluminum cans is a $1 billion/year industry in this country.
        Recycling one aluminum can saves enough energy to run a television for three hours.-->
        <!-- Recycling is important because extensive amounts of waste can have negative impacts on our environment. In the recent years where recycling has become more prevalent, the US consistently ranks last in recycling rates. Top countries in Europe such as Germany, recycle 70% of all their wastes while the United States lags behind at 34%.
